Dear Hiring Manager,

#v(0.5em)

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Victoria, with an expected graduation date of April 2027. I am writing to express my strong interest in the SAP iXp Intern – Agile Test Developer position. Having followed SAP's innovative approach to enterprise software solutions and commitment to quality assurance through advanced testing methodologies, I am eager to contribute to your team. Through my academic coursework and professional internships, I have developed strong expertise in end-to-end test automation and full-stack development with CI/CD practices, which I am confident will enable me to contribute meaningfully to your testing framework initiatives.

My comprehensive approach to test automation stems from developing a robust 6,000-assertion rspec/factorybot test suite at Leanpub that covered critical GraphQL endpoints and complex business logic, teaching me how to create scalable test suites that maintain reliability as codebases evolve. At Trustscience, I implemented Playwright-based UI tests that verified end-to-end user interactions, ensuring seamless frontend experiences across browsers and devices while identifying edge cases that could impact user experience. This experience extended naturally to risk-analysis best practices, where I focused on identifying critical failure points in publishing workflows and implementing robust error-handling systems. Developing a background job progress-tracking system using Redis and progress bars with reliable completion and failure handling further strengthened my ability to build automated regression suites addressing risk factors in complex enterprise systems, aligning with SAP's need for thorough test scenario design.

My experience in cloud-native development and CI/CD practices provides direct preparation for SAP's environment migration and continuous delivery initiatives. At Trustscience, I deployed a containerized application on Fly.io with a Caddy reverse proxy, implementing type-safe database layers and demonstrating my ability to work with infrastructure-as-code principles—skills that transfer well to SAP's environment assessment projects. Earlier, I developed a production-grade file version-control system using HTTP/2 and JSON Patch that reduced AWS S3 costs by 15% through delta storage techniques, showcasing my ability to optimize resource usage during migrations. My Java-based Text Adventure project, where I applied Factory and Command patterns to create an event-driven game engine, provided a strong foundation in object-oriented design valuable for collaborating with SAP's agile developers.

My background in comprehensive test automation frameworks combined with CI/CD environment migration experience positions me to contribute immediately to SAP's testing initiatives. I am particularly adept at identifying risk factors in complex systems and implementing mitigation strategies through robust testing. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my qualifications align with your team's objectives and contribute to SAP's commitment to high-quality enterprise solutions.

Sincerely,

Sam McClenaghan
